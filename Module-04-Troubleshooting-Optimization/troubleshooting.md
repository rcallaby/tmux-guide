# Troubleshooting and Optimization

Troubleshooting and optimizing tmux can feel like a puzzle at times, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a game-changer for making your terminal workflow smooth and hassle-free. On the troubleshooting side, it’s mostly about tackling common hiccups like key bindings not working, layouts breaking, or sessions mysteriously disappearing. The first step is usually digging into your `.tmux.conf` file—this is where most of the magic (and the occasional mess) happens. Whether it’s tweaking a misbehaving plugin or figuring out why your custom shortcuts are clashing, it all comes down to knowing where to look and testing changes step by step. And let’s not forget the trusty `tmux logs` command for pinpointing errors when things really go sideways.

When it comes to optimization, it’s all about making tmux work *for you*. This means fine-tuning settings to speed up redraws, keeping plugins lean and efficient, and customizing things like status bars to give you just the right amount of info without overloading your screen. Small tweaks like reducing history limits or disabling unused features can go a long way in improving performance, especially if you’re juggling multiple sessions and panes. With a little time spent tailoring tmux to your workflow, it’ll feel less like just another terminal tool and more like an extension of your brain—fast, reliable, and always ready to jump back into action.


## Debugging tmux
---

## 1. **Check the `tmux` Version**
Ensure you're using a stable and supported version of `tmux`. Some issues may stem from outdated versions or features missing in older releases.

```bash
tmux -V
```

If the version is outdated, update it using your system's package manager or build it from source for the latest features and bug fixes.

### Common Issues with Older Versions:
- Deprecated configuration options.
- Incompatibility with newer terminal emulators or plugins.
- Missing features or bug fixes.

---

## 2. **Debugging with `tmux` Logs**

`tmux` provides a built-in logging mechanism to capture detailed information about its internal operations. To enable logging:

### Enable Logging for a Session
Run `tmux` with verbose logging enabled:
```bash
tmux -vvvv -L debug-session new-session
```
- `-vvvv`: Sets the logging verbosity to maximum (4 levels).
- `-L debug-session`: Uses a custom server name to isolate this debugging session.

This generates log files in `/tmp/`:
```bash
/tmp/tmux-server-PID.log
```

### Analyzing Logs
- Open the log file in a text editor:
  ```bash
  less /tmp/tmux-server-12345.log
  ```
- Look for errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior in commands, such as:
  - Key binding mismatches.
  - Pane synchronization issues.
  - Errors loading configuration files.

---

## 3. **Debugging `.tmux.conf`**

### Validate Configuration
Errors in `.tmux.conf` can cause `tmux` to fail on startup or behave unexpectedly. Validate your configuration:
```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```
If there’s a syntax error, it will be displayed in the terminal.

### Isolate Problematic Sections
Comment out parts of `.tmux.conf` and reload it incrementally:
```bash
# Reload configuration
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```
Pay close attention to:
- Key bindings (`bind-key`).
- Plugins or scripts.
- Terminal capabilities (e.g., `set -g default-terminal`).

---

## 4. **Terminal Compatibility Issues**

`tmux` relies on terminal capabilities defined in the `TERM` environment variable. Debugging terminal compatibility is crucial for resolving rendering and key input issues.

### Check Terminal Type
Ensure `TERM` is correctly set inside and outside `tmux`:
```bash
echo $TERM
```
- Outside `tmux`: Should match your terminal emulator, e.g., `xterm-256color`.
- Inside `tmux`: Should typically be `screen`, `screen-256color`, or `tmux-256color`.

### Resolve Mismatches
Set the correct terminal type in `.tmux.conf`:
```bash
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
```

If using a custom terminal type, verify it is installed in `terminfo`:
```bash
infocmp tmux-256color
```
If missing, install it:
```bash
tic -x tmux-256color.terminfo
```

---

## 5. **Key Binding Debugging**

### Identify the Problem
If key bindings are not working:
1. Use `show-bindings` to inspect current bindings:
   ```bash
   tmux list-keys
   ```
2. Look for conflicts or unexpected commands.

### Debug Key Sequences
Some bindings may fail due to terminal input discrepancies. Use `cat` to inspect raw key sequences:
```bash
cat > /dev/null
```
Press the problematic key combination and observe the output. Match it with your binding in `.tmux.conf`.

### Testing Key Bindings
Test individual bindings directly in `tmux`:
```bash
tmux bind-key -n C-a new-window
```

---

## 6. **Session and Pane Debugging**

### Session Issues
If `tmux` sessions behave unexpectedly:
- List all sessions:
  ```bash
  tmux list-sessions
  ```
- Attach to a specific session to inspect its state:
  ```bash
  tmux attach-session -t <session_name>
  ```

### Pane Issues
For issues with panes:
- List panes in the current session:
  ```bash
  tmux list-panes
  ```
- Inspect pane IDs and states:
  ```bash
  tmux display-message -p "#{pane_id} #{pane_current_command}"
  ```

### Force Pane Redraw
If a pane is not displaying correctly:
```bash
tmux refresh-client -S
```

---

## 7. **Plugins and Extensions**

If using plugins (e.g., via TPM), they may introduce issues.

### Disable All Plugins
Temporarily disable plugins by commenting out their entries in `.tmux.conf`, then reload the configuration.

### Debug Specific Plugins
Check plugin logs (if available) or consult the plugin documentation for troubleshooting steps.

---

## 8. **Advanced Techniques**

### Strace `tmux` Process
Use `strace` to trace system calls made by `tmux`:
```bash
strace -o tmux_strace.log -f tmux
```
Analyze the `tmux_strace.log` file for errors like permission issues or missing files.

### Attach a Debugger
For in-depth debugging, attach `gdb` to the `tmux` process:
```bash
gdb -p $(pgrep tmux)
```

---

## 9. **Common Issues and Solutions**

### Symptom: `tmux` Crashes on Startup
1. Run `tmux` with verbose logging to capture the error.
2. Validate `.tmux.conf` for syntax errors or unsupported commands.

### Symptom: Pane Synchronization Not Working
- Verify `setw synchronize-panes` is correctly set.
- Check if plugins or scripts are interfering.

### Symptom: Garbled Text or Display Issues
- Ensure `TERM` is correctly set.
- Force pane redraw with:
  ```bash
  tmux refresh-client -S
  ```
- If using SSH, confirm remote and local terminals use compatible `TERM` values.

### Symptom: Key Bindings Not Responding
- Debug key sequences using `cat > /dev/null`.
- Check `list-keys` for conflicting bindings.

---

## 10. **Best Practices**

1. **Backup Configuration**: Maintain a backup of working `.tmux.conf` files to revert to a known good state.
2. **Test Incrementally**: When making changes, test configurations incrementally to isolate problems.
3. **Keep Logs**: Regularly enable logging during major configuration changes to capture useful debugging data.

# Performance Optimization in `tmux`
---

## 1. **Optimize `.tmux.conf`**

### Avoid Excessive Scripting
`tmux.conf` often includes scripts or plugins that can introduce latency. Simplify your configuration to essential settings by:

- Avoiding unnecessary loops or complex commands.
- Reducing the number of plugins, especially those that constantly update (e.g., status bar scripts).

### Example: Minimal Status Bar
A simple status bar reduces processing overhead:
```tmux
set -g status-bg black
set -g status-fg white
set -g status-left ''
set -g status-right ''
```

### Reduce Update Intervals
The status bar's frequent updates can slow `tmux`. Set a reasonable update interval:
```tmux
set -g status-interval 10
```
This updates the status bar every 10 seconds instead of the default 15 or shorter intervals used by heavy configurations.

---

## 2. **Rendering and Redraw Efficiency**

### Optimize Redraw Settings
Rendering inefficiencies can cause slowdowns in complex layouts or large sessions. Adjust redraw settings:
```tmux
set -g redraw-delay 100
```
This reduces the delay (in milliseconds) for redrawing panes and windows. Lower values may improve responsiveness but can increase CPU usage.

### Enable Escape-Time Tuning
Escape sequence parsing can impact performance, especially with complex key bindings. Tune the escape-time setting:
```tmux
set -sg escape-time 0
```
Setting this to `0` reduces the delay when processing escape sequences, improving responsiveness.

---

## 3. **Optimize Pane and Window Management**

### Limit the Number of Panes
The more panes open in a session, the higher the rendering overhead. Close unused panes or consolidate tasks where possible:
- Use fewer panes per session for resource-intensive tasks.
- Split tasks across multiple `tmux` sessions instead of managing everything in one session.

### Use Pane Synchronization Judiciously
Pane synchronization (`setw synchronize-panes on`) can be resource-heavy when sending inputs to multiple panes. Turn it off when not needed:
```tmux
setw synchronize-panes off
```

---

## 4. **Terminal Emulator Settings**

### Use a Performance-Optimized Terminal
Some terminal emulators are better suited for `tmux` in terms of rendering performance. Consider using lightweight terminal emulators like:
- `alacritty`
- `kitty`
- `xterm`
  
Ensure your terminal emulator supports:
- True color (24-bit color).
- Hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU rendering in `alacritty` or `kitty`).

### Set an Appropriate `TERM`
The `TERM` variable affects how `tmux` communicates with the terminal. Use an optimized value:
```bash
export TERM=tmux-256color
```
Ensure the terminfo database includes the `tmux-256color` entry. If missing, install it with:
```bash
tic -x tmux-256color.terminfo
```

---

## 5. **Manage Plugins and Extensions**

### Reduce Plugin Overhead
Popular `tmux` plugin managers like `TPM` (Tmux Plugin Manager) can add functionality but may degrade performance if too many plugins are active. Keep only essential plugins.

### Profile Plugins
Identify resource-intensive plugins by disabling them one at a time and monitoring performance. Common culprits include:
- Continuous logging or monitoring plugins.
- Plugins that update the status bar too frequently.

---

## 6. **System Resource Optimization**

### Increase Scrollback Buffer Only When Needed
A large scrollback buffer consumes more memory and can slow `tmux` operations like pane switching. Use a reasonable value:
```tmux
set -g history-limit 5000
```
Reduce the history limit if you don't need extensive scrollback.

### Adjust CPU Priority
If `tmux` sessions are lagging during high system load, increase `tmux`'s CPU priority:
```bash
sudo renice -n -5 -p $(pgrep tmux)
```
This gives `tmux` a higher priority, improving responsiveness under heavy workloads.

---

## 7. **Optimize SSH Sessions**

When using `tmux` over SSH, latency and rendering performance can degrade due to network overhead.

### Enable SSH Compression
Use compression to reduce data transfer during remote sessions:
```bash
ssh -C user@remotehost
```

### Adjust Remote Terminal Settings
On the remote host, ensure that `tmux` is using an optimized terminal type:
```bash
export TERM=screen-256color
```

---

## 8. **Performance Monitoring Tools**

### Monitor `tmux` Resource Usage
Use `htop` or `top` to check `tmux`'s CPU and memory usage:
```bash
htop
```
Identify high resource usage by plugins or processes within `tmux`.

### Profile `tmux` Performance
Run `tmux` with verbose logging to analyze performance bottlenecks:
```bash
tmux -vvvv
```
Inspect `/tmp/tmux-server-*.log` for delays or resource-intensive operations.

---

## 9. **Use Efficient Workflows**

### Offload Heavy Tasks
Avoid running resource-intensive tasks (e.g., large compilations) directly in `tmux` panes. Instead:
- Use background jobs (`&`) or tools like `nohup`.
- Redirect output to files instead of keeping it in the terminal buffer.

### Leverage Multiple Sessions
Divide workloads across multiple `tmux` sessions rather than a single overloaded session.

---

## 10. **Additional Advanced Settings**

### Disable Automatic Renaming
Pane and window renaming triggers extra processing. Disable it:
```tmux
set -g allow-rename off
```

### Adjust Cursor Blink
Frequent cursor blinking can add overhead. Disable it:
```tmux
set -g set-titles off
```

---

## 11. **Troubleshooting Performance**

### Symptom: High CPU Usage
- **Cause**: Excessive status bar updates, too many panes, or heavy plugins.
- **Solution**: Reduce status bar intervals, close unused panes, and simplify `.tmux.conf`.

### Symptom: Slow Pane Switching
- **Cause**: Large scrollback buffer or inefficient terminal settings.
- **Solution**: Reduce `history-limit` and ensure `TERM` is correctly set.

### Symptom: Lag Over SSH
- **Cause**: Network latency or improper terminal settings.
- **Solution**: Enable SSH compression and ensure remote `TERM` compatibility.

---

## 12. **Best Practices**

1. **Keep Configuration Simple**: Avoid overloading `.tmux.conf` with unnecessary features.
2. **Test Changes Incrementally**: Modify one setting at a time to observe its impact.
3. **Monitor Resource Usage Regularly**: Periodically check `tmux`'s performance with system tools.
4. **Update Regularly**: Use the latest stable version of `tmux` and terminal emulators for bug fixes and performance improvements.

## Session Recovery

Session recovery in `tmux` is essential when you lose your session due to system reboots, accidental disconnections, or SSH timeout. `tmux` offers built-in features, complemented by external tools and practices, to ensure that sessions can be restored with minimal effort and disruption.

---

## 1. **Understanding tmux Sessions and Persistence**

### What Is a tmux Session?
A `tmux` session is a running instance of `tmux` with one or more windows and panes. Each session is independent, and you can attach or detach from it without terminating the processes running inside.

### Default Behavior
When you detach from a `tmux` session (via `Ctrl-b d` or loss of terminal connection), the session continues to run in the background. You can reattach later using:
```bash
tmux attach-session
```

However, in case of system restarts or crashes, sessions terminate unless recovery strategies are in place.

---

## 2. **Session Recovery with tmux Resurrect**

### What Is `tmux-resurrect`?
[`tmux-resurrect`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) is a popular plugin that allows you to save and restore `tmux` sessions, including pane layouts, commands, and working directories.

### How to Install `tmux-resurrect`
1. Install [Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) if not already installed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
   ```
   Add this to your `.tmux.conf`:
   ```bash
   set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
   ```

2. Install `tmux-resurrect`:
   Add the following to your `.tmux.conf`:
   ```bash
   set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
   ```

3. Reload your configuration and install plugins:
   Press `Ctrl-b` then `I` to install `tmux-resurrect`.

### How to Use `tmux-resurrect`
- **Save a Session**:
  Press `Ctrl-b` then `Ctrl-s` to save the current session state.
- **Restore a Session**:
  Press `Ctrl-b` then `Ctrl-r` to restore the saved session.

### What Gets Restored?
- Pane layout and sizes.
- Commands running in each pane.
- Working directories of panes.

### Limitations
- Processes started inside panes are not restored unless combined with tools like `tmux-continuum` or scripts to reinitialize them.
- Saved sessions may not fully recover GUI-based applications or interactive scripts.

---

## 3. **Using tmux Continuum for Automatic Recovery**

### What Is `tmux-continuum`?
[`tmux-continuum`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum) builds on `tmux-resurrect` to add automatic periodic saving of sessions and auto-start functionality after a system reboot.

### How to Install `tmux-continuum`
Add the following to your `.tmux.conf`:
```bash
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
```
Reload the configuration and install the plugin using `Ctrl-b I`.

### Configure Auto-Save and Auto-Start
Enable automatic saving of sessions:
```bash
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
set -g @continuum-save-interval '15'
```
This saves the session every 15 minutes and restores it automatically when you restart `tmux`.

---

## 4. **Native Methods for Manual Recovery**

If you prefer not to use plugins, you can rely on built-in `tmux` functionality and manual techniques.

### Save Session Layouts
Export the current session layout using:
```bash
tmux list-windows -t session_name > session_layout.txt
```

### Restore Session Layouts
Manually recreate the session layout using:
```bash
tmux source-file session_layout.txt
```

### Save Active Processes
List active commands in a session with:
```bash
tmux list-panes -s -F "#{pane_id}: #{pane_current_command}"
```
Save this output to a file and manually restart processes if needed.

---

## 5. **Recovering After System Reboot**

When a system restarts, all running `tmux` sessions are lost unless mitigated. Use the following approaches:

### Use a Systemd Service to Keep tmux Running
You can configure `tmux` as a persistent service using `systemd`:

1. Create a systemd unit file for `tmux`:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tmux.service
   ```

2. Add the following configuration:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=tmux session manager
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/tmux new-session -d -s my-session
   ExecStop=/usr/bin/tmux kill-session -t my-session
   Restart=always
   User=your-username

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Enable the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable tmux.service
   sudo systemctl start tmux.service
   ```

This ensures `tmux` starts automatically after a reboot.

### Use a Wrapper Script
Create a custom wrapper script to reinitialize common sessions:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
tmux new-session -d -s main
tmux send-keys -t main 'cd /path/to/project && ./start.sh' C-m
tmux attach-session -t main
```

---

## 6. **Handling SSH Disconnects**

### Reattach to Existing Sessions
After an SSH disconnect, list available sessions:
```bash
tmux list-sessions
```
Reattach to a session:
```bash
tmux attach-session -t session_name
```

### Use Persistent SSH Connections
Prevent frequent disconnects by enabling SSH connection persistence. Add the following to your `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ServerAliveCountMax 5
```

---

## 7. **Advanced Recovery Techniques**

### Combine tmux with Shell Scripting
For advanced recovery, integrate `tmux` commands with shell scripts to automate pane recreation:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
tmux new-session -d -s recovery
tmux split-window -h
tmux send-keys -t recovery:0.0 'top' C-m
tmux send-keys -t recovery:0.1 'htop' C-m
tmux attach-session -t recovery
```

### Use Persistent Storage for Logs
Redirect critical session logs to files:
```bash
tmux pipe-pane -o 'cat >> /path/to/log.txt'
```
This allows you to review session activity after a crash.

---

## 8. **Best Practices for tmux Session Recovery**

1. **Automate Saving**: Use `tmux-resurrect` or `tmux-continuum` for regular backups.
2. **Test Restorations**: Periodically test your recovery setup to ensure reliability.
3. **Document Sessions**: Maintain a script or configuration file for frequently used sessions and layouts.
4. **Leverage Systemd**: Use system services to start and persist `tmux` sessions after a reboot.

---

By following these methods, you can effectively recover and restore `tmux` sessions, ensuring minimal disruption to your workflow even after unexpected interruptions. Let me know if you'd like further elaboration on any of these techniques!
